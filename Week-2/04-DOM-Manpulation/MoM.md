# The Secret to a Job in Tech:
1. Crafting your Story
   - Why are you in this interview? The story we are going to tell is
     one of the first barrier that explain I am more than a bootcamp.
   - I am broke and I had bills to pay [We can't say this]
   - Create a story that binds together everything that we've done
     and answers the question: why are you here.[Positive]
2. Online Presence:
   - Small Company will look at our profile[Tech-Interviewer]
   - Combine our powers: [Portfolio+Twitter+LinkedIn]
     - Twitter Profile:
       
       - Nyah(Athena Health): https://twitter.com/nyahmacklindev
       - Your Inclusive Tech Leader
       - Founder, CTO @AfrosinAi
       - #BlackTechTwitter
       - @ResilientCoders - the homies fr.

       - Ibrahim Gurhan
       - @ibrahimCodes
       - Software Engineer based in Boston
       - Love working with clodud & serverless tech. I also love 
         graphic design/playing chess and learning languages
       - Boston, MA[Location]  GitHub-Link: https://github.com/xyz

       - This good, because speaking about yourself in positive terms.
       - Twitter is a magical place where developers like to hang out.
       - Profile Picture: Take a headshot with your phone, remove the
         background if you have to, smile, sunlight, upload on twitter.
       - Make sure your title says you are a software engineer.
       - Put your location
       - If you have portfolio, make sure to link by now. And if not,
         create a new. [Small Companies may find your portfolio via
         twitter]
       - Whereever you are going to apply, like Bangalore, Delhi, 
         follow atleast 50 engineers in that location. If you are
         remote, you need to find a remote hashtag and follow 50 
         engineers using that remote hashtag - NETWORKING in TWITTER.
       - Like their post, retweet everyone once in a while. Because
         if you are liking somebody and retweeting their tweet, they
         will like us back. Especially if they don't have any 
         followers.
       - This is the easiest network you could ever do, and when it
         comes time to  finding a job, we can go back to these 50 to
         connect you to their networks. So, we are going to start by
         following, retweeting, liking. We should probably put our
         own content on a tool like buffer. [Don't use too much social,
         create 2-3 weeks of content, automate your twitter content
         using auto postiong tool - buffer.]

       - If we are just clicking apply on job posts, we are going up
         against all the people that are getting referred. Basically we
         are throwing our resume in trash cane, so get a referral.


       - LinkedIn/AngelList:
         - Make sure your location is set on LinkedIn.
         - Make sure your contact info is set on LinkedIn. 
           [AlwaysUpdate]
         - Update your LinkedIn URL to have your full name. This helps
           the search engine to rank our profile better and when people
           type our name in search engine. the linkedin is the first 
           things that popup.
         - The story we are crafting should be in the about section.

# How to ace your technical interview:
- Google the company's interview process
- Ask them about the round, and expected topics
- Look on GitHub, Glassdoor, Leetcode etc, about the interview process.
  [Sometimes we found the exact question they ask on interview]

PREP: [Parameters-Returns-Examples-PseucoCode] (Coding Challenge)
- PREP helps us:
  - To better understand the problem
  - Start to process our solution
  - Build a rapport with our interviewer
- Don't solve a coding challenge without doing PREP.

- Technical Interview test two things:
  - Can you code?
  - Do I want to work with this person for the next two years?
  - So, by working with PREP, we can take tha time to build the rapport
    with our interviewer so at the end they go: "This is a great 
    person, I really like talking with them, I would definitely want 
    to work with next two years. So, I'm going to vote that we hire
    them".
- Never show you excited face that you have already know the problem.

There are three types of questions that we are going to run into an
interview:
1. Methods Problems: Solve problem using the methods.
   - If the interview is 45min, then take atleast 15min for PREP.
   - Meaning walk through the parameters, the returns, the examples
     and the pseudocode.
   - The reason we are doing that because PREP develop a communication
     between us & interviewer, and it also burns time.
   - We are going to solve the problem, but we might not get the more
     optimal solution.
   - As we are going through PREP, and if we have a reasonable chance
     of making it an optimal solution.
     a. Solve using in-built methods
     b. The solve using brute-force i.e. using big-4: [Default]
        - Variables
        - Conditionals
        - Loops
        - Functions
     c. Optimal Solution:
        If we have time then come up with optimal solutions:
        Data Structure & Algorithm help us to come up with more 
        optimal solutions

- PREP: 15 min
- Brute Force: 20 min [Ugly Code but solves the problem]
- Discuss that you can do slightly better, make it more optimized
  and take a little bit time to get across the line: 5-10 min
  [If it's not FAANG, there is good chance that this might work].
- For FAANG, process is same but we need little bit more DSA.

Note: Before going to interview, already setup your Environment or IDE.
[Use replit, because all the setup are already prepared.]

- When you practice for your technical interview, always imagine 
  yourself in the interview, talking to an actual interviewer. 
- Verbalize everything that you are doing. Don't stop talking while
  practicing.

Example: Function word say is a palindrome
1. Can I ask a series of question just to make sure I understand the
   problem, Is that okay Bob? Yes!
   - I am asking many questions and I am getting them talking 
     immediately and one of the oldest sales trick in the book is to
     get your person saying yes as early and as often as possible.
   - Ask just to confirm: Is palindrome a word that is the same \
     forwards and backwards? Yes!
   - Then I will again ask a series of problem to make sure I   
     understand the problem:
   - We are taking a word as input, and there are a few things I want
     to clarify:
   - Parameters:
     - Will a word always be passed in are String? Yes!
     - Will the string ever be empty? No!
     - Will the string ever have any special characters? No!
     - Will there ever be numbers? No!
     - Will this word be case sensitive? Uppercase & lowercase? No!
     - Will there be multiple words or singular word? One Word
   - Return:
     - What should it 'return'? 
     - String Palindrome/Not-Palindrome
     - Boolean => return true || false
   - Examples:
     - racecar -> true
     - bob     -> true
     - tacos   -> false

function isPalindrome(word) {
  // word - reverse that word - split reverse join
  let reversedWord = word.split('').reverse().join('');
  // revWord === word => true
  if(word === reversedWord) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

function isPalindrome(word) {
  let reversedWord = word.split('').reverse().join('');
  return word === reversedWord;
}

const isPalindrome = word => word === word.split('').reverse().join('');


console.log(isPalindrome('racecar'));
console.log(isPalindrome('bob'));
console.log(isPalindrome('tacos'));

Note: Whole time I was talking.

2. Leetcode: DSA
- Once we can take swings at 6Kyu at Code Wars, probably time to leave
  Code Wars, and move to Leetcode.
- Brute Force
- Optimized [Data Structures & Algorithms]
