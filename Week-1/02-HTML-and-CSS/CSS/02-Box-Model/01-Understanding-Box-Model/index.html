        /**
         * The Box Model:
         * - Box sizing controls how browser calculates total width/height of elements:
         *   
         *   a. Content-box (Default):
         *      - Width/height only sets content area
         *      - If width:100px, padding:10px, border:5px
         *        Then total width = 100 + (10×2) + (5×2) = 130px
         *   
         *   b. Border-box (Modern):
         *      - Width/height includes everything
         *      - Total width = the width you specify
         *      - If width:100px, padding:10px, border:5px
         *        Then content width = 100 - (10×2) - (5×2) = 70px
         * 
         * - Every single thing in a web development is a box.
         * - Everything is trying to take horizontal and vertical space.
         *   So, box model is concerned with why & how does it take up 
         *   space? Because other things we want to have stuffs inside of
         *   other stuff and if we don't know how much space things are
         *   taking up, we can't sit stuffs next to each other.
         * 
         *   section {
         *      height: 100px;
         *      width: 100px;
         *   }
         * 
         * => It will draw a nice square box.
         * 
         * Q. Let's say I have an article and I want to put that sections
         *    inside of my article, which is 300px wide, how many of these
         *    sections will fit inside my article?
         * => 3 sections
         * 
         * When it comes to the box model, there are three really important
         * things:
         * 1. Going horizontally, we have:
         *    a. width
         *    b. then we have padding
         *    c. then we have border
         * 2. Going vertically, we have:
         *    a. height
         *    b. then we have padding
         *    c. then we have border
         * 
         *     +-------------B  O  R  D  E  R----------------+    
         *     |             P  A  D  D  I  N  G             |    
         *     |    +-----------------------------------+    |    
         *     |    |  H                                |    |    
         *     |    |  E                                |    |    
         *     |    |  I                                |    |    
         *     |    |  G                                |    |    
         *     |    |  H        W I D T H               |    |    
         *     |    +--T--------------------------------+    |    
         *     |                                             |    
         *     +---------------------------------------------+    
         *                                                        
         * => These are the 3 things that we can control that take up size 
         *    when we try to calculate according to box model.
         * Note: Margin is a bully. It is used to push around the box model
         *       but not necessarily something that we can consider a true
         *       part of the box.
         * 
         * Border:
         * Q. How wide is this element?
         *   section {
         *      height: 100px;
         *      width: 100px;
         *      border: 5px solid black;
         *   }
         * => This element is 110px wide.
         *    5pxLHS + 100pxwidth + 5pxRHS = 110px total
         * 
         *    a. border-width  : Sets the thickness
         *    b. border-style  : Defines the type(solid, dashed, dotted)
         *    c. border-color  : Sets the color
         *    d. border-radius : Rounds corners
         * 
         *       div {
         *         border: 2px solid black;
         *         border-radius: 10px;
         *       }
         * 
         * Padding: [Space inside an element]
         * => Padding increases the distance between the element and its
         *    border. So, padding pushes the border away from the element.
         * 
         * Q. How wide is this element?
         *   section {
         *      height: 100px;
         *      width: 100px;
         *      border: 5px solid black;
         *      padding-right: 20px; 
         *   }
         * 
         * => 5pxLHS + 100px Width + 20pxPadding + 5pxRHS = 130px
         * 
         * Q. If I have an article that was 300px wide, and I want to sit
         *    the section inside that article, how many section can we fit?
         * => 2 section, and the 3rd one will run out of room and break the
         *    next line.
         * 
         * Margin: [Space outisde an element]
         * => Margin pushes the box model around. So, if we add margin on 
         *    the top, it would push our box model to the down. And if we
         *    have margin on the left, then it will push the box to the 
         *    right.
