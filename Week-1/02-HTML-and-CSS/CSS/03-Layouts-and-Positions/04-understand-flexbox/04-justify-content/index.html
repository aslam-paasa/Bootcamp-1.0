         *    the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or
         *    before them.
         * 
         * b. flex-end: 
         *    All items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting
         *    on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space
         *    between or after them.
         * 
         * c. center: All items will be positioned in order, in the center of the
         *    parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
         * 
         * d. space-around: Items will be positioned with equal space before and
         *    after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
         * 
         * e. space-between: Items will be positioned with equal space between
         *    them, but no extra space before the first or after the last items.
