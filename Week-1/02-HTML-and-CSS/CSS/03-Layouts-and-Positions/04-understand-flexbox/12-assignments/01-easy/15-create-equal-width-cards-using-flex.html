         * Assignment-15: 
         * Create 3 equal-width cards inside a container using flex: 1.
         * All cards should have equal space even if the content inside them
         * is different.
        */

        /**
         * What you'll learn:
         * 1. Use flex: 1 to make cards take equal width.
         * 2. Understand how flexbox distributes space between items.
         * 3. The power of flex: 1 to create equal-width layouts.
         * 
         * flex: 1 is a shorthand for:
         * a. flex-grow: 1
         * b. flex-shrink: 1
         * c. flex-basis: 0
         * 
         * This means:
         * a. All items grow equally to fill the container.
         * b. They shrink equally if space is limited.
         * c. flex-basis: 0 tells them to start from zero width, then grow
         *    equally.
         * 
         * Note: Perfect for equal-sized boxes, like cards:
         * 
         * +------------------+------------------+------------------+
         * |     Card 1       |     Card 2       |     Card 3       |
         * +------------------+------------------+------------------+
         * (All have same width regardless of content)
        */
