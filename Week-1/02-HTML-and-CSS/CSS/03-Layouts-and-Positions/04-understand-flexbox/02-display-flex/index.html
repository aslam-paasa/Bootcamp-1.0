         * - Flex containers are helpful tools for creating websites that
         *   respond to changes in screen sizes.
         * - Child elements of flex containers will change size and location
         *   in response to the size and position of their parent container.
         * 
         * - For an element to become a flex container, its 'display' property
         *   must be set to 'flex'.
