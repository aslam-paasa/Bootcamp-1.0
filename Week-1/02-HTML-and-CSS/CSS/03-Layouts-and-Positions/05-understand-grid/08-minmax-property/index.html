        /**
         * Minmax Property in CSS Grid:
         * - Until now, all the grids we've created have been fixed size
         *   (like 400px width and 500px height)
         * 
         * - But in real websites, grids need to change their size based on 
         *   the browser window size
         * 
         * - In this situation, we want columns and rows to be neither too 
         *   small nor too large
         * 
         * - Example: If you have a 100px wide image in your grid, you don't 
         *   want its column to become smaller than 100px
         * 
         * - The minmax() function solves this problem
         * - Syntax: minmax(minimum_size, maximum_size)
         * - This function makes columns/rows flexible between minimum and 
         *   maximum sizes

               Column 1: Fixed 100px width
               Column 2: Flexible width (between 100px and 500px)
               Column 3: Fixed 100px width
               
               When browser window resizes:
               - First and third columns will always stay 100px
               - Middle column will adjust between 100px and 500px
