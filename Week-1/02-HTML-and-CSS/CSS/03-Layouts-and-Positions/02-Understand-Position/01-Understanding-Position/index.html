        /**
         * Why learn position after float?
         * - When using float, you're kind of hacking layout by making things
         *   "fight for corners". But floats weren't meant for full page
         *   layouts- they were originally for wrapping text around images!
         *   So, after floats became messy for layout, developers turned to
         *   'position', which gave more direct and powerful control over
         *   where elements sits on the page.
        */

        /**
         * Understanding Position:
         * CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
         * This box will either be a block-level box or an inline-level box.
         * 
         * 1. Block-level elements:
         *    - Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main
         *      building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow 
         *      between surrounding text.
         *    - You can control how much space each box takes up by setting
         *      the width of the boxes(and sometimes the height, too).
         *    - To separate boxes, we can use borders, margins, padding,
         *      and background colors. 
         *    - Ex: Block-Level Element: <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>
         *          (Start on a new line)
         * 
         *    - The block-level elements in the above take up their own line
         *      of space and therefore don't overlap each other.
         *    - Block-level elements also consistently appear on the left
         *      side of the browser. 
         *    - This is the default position for block-level elements.
         * 
         * Note: The default position of an element can be changed by setting
         *       its 'position' property. The position property can be take
         *       one of the five values:
         *       a. static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
         *       b. relative
         *       c. absolute
         *       d. fixed
         *       e. sticky
         */

        /**
         * 1. Position: Relative
         *    - One way to modify the default position of an element is by
         *      setting its 'position' property to 'relative'.
         *    - This value allows you to position an element relative to its
         *      default static position on the web page.
         * 
         *      .green-box {
         *          background-color: green;
         *          position: relative;
         *       }
         * 
         *    - Although the code in the example above instructs the browser
         *      to expect a relative positioning of the .green-box element,
         *      it does not specify where the .green-box element should be
         *      positioned on the page. This is done by accompanying the
         *      'position' declaration with one or more of the following 
         *      offset properties that will move the element away from its
         *      default static position:
         *      a. top    : moves the element down from the top.
         *      b. right  : moves the element up from the bottom.
         *      c. bottom : moves the element away from the left side(to the right)
         *      d. left   : moves the element away from the right side(to the left)
         * 
         *    - You can specify values in pixels, ems, or percentages, among others,
         *      to dial in exactly how far you need the element to move. It's also
         *      important to note that offset properties will not work if the element's
         *      'position' property is the default 'static'. 
         * 
         *      .green-box {
         *          background-color: green;
         *          position: relative;
         *          top: 50px;
         *          left: 120px;
         *       }
         * 
         *    - In this example above, the element of green-box class will be moved
         *      down by 50px, and to the right 120px, from its default static position.
         *      The green-box class is applied in HTML to the green box only.
        */

        /**
         * 2. Position: Absolute
         * - Absolute position removes the element from the normal document flow
         * - The element positions itself relative to its nearest positioned parent
         * - If no parent has position set, it positions relative to the document
         * 
         * Example:
         * <div class="parent">
         *     <div class="child">I'm absolute!</div>
         * </div>
         * 
         * .parent {
         *     position: relative;  /* Important! * /
         *     width: 300px;
         *     height: 200px;
         *     background: #eee;
         * }
         * 
         * .child {
         *     position: absolute;
         *     top: 20px;     /* 20px from top of parent * /
         *     right: 30px;   /* 30px from right of parent * /
         *     background: #ff0000;
         * }
         */


        /**
         * 2. Position: Absolute
         *    - Another way of modifying the position of an element is by 
         *      setting its position to 'absolute'.
         *    - When an element's position is set to 'absolute', all other
         *      elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it
         *      is not present on the page. 
         *    - The element will be positioned 'relative' to its closest
         *      positioned parent element, while offset properties can be
         *      used to determine the final position from there. 
         *    - Always remember to set position: relative on the parent 
         *      element.
         * 
         *    - Consider the example below:
         * 
         *      <div class="parent">
         *          <div class="child">I'm absolute!</div>
         *      </div>
         * 
         *      .parent {
         *          position: relative;
         *          width: 300px;
         *          height: 200px;
         *          background: #eee;
         *      }
         * 
         *      .child {
         *          position: absolute;
         *          top: 20px;
         *          right: 30px;
         *          background: #ff0000;
         *      }
         * 
         *    - In the above example, we have a parent div with position: relative
         *      and a child div with position: absolute.
         *    - The child div is positioned 20px from the top and 30px from the right
         *      of its parent container, not the page.
         *    - This happens because the parent has position: relative, making it the
         *      positioning context for the absolutely positioned child.
         *    - Without position: relative on the parent, the child would position
         *      itself relative to the document body.
        */

        /**
         * 3. Position: Fixed
         *    - Fixed position is a type of positioning that permanently sticks
         *      an element to a specific spot on the page
         *    - When you scroll the page, this element won't move from its position
         *    - To use it, we set position: fixed along with these properties:
         *      a. top   : distance from top
         *      b. bottom: distance from bottom
         *      c. left  : distance from left
         *      d. right : distance from right
         * 
         *      .title {
         *          position: fixed;
         *          top: 0px;    
         *          left: 0px; 
         *       }
         * 
         * Note: In the example above, the '.title' element will be permanently
         *       fixed to the top-left corner of the page. No matter how much
         *       you scroll, this element will stay in its position.
        */

        /**
         * 4. Position: Sticky
         *    - Sticky positioning is a feature that makes an element "stick" to a
         *      specific position while scrolling
         *    - It scrolls like normal elements, but when it reaches a specific
         *      position (like top: 240px), it sticks there
         * 
         *    Example:
         *      .box-bottom {
         *          position: sticky;
         *          top: 240px;
         *          background-color: darkgreen;
         *      }
         * 
         *    - In the above example:
         *      1. The box will scroll normally
         *      2. When the box reaches 240px from the top, it will stick there
         *      3. The box will stay stuck until the parent container ends
         *      4. After the parent container ends, the box will scroll normally
         * 
         *    Use Cases:
         *    - To keep table headers visible while scrolling
         *    - To make navigation menus stick to the top
         *    - To keep important information always visible
        */


        /**
         * Concept of Stacking Order and Z-Index Property:
         * - Z-index is a property that tells how an element should appear on
         *   the webpage - whether it should be on top or behind other elements.
         * - Just like you can stack pieces of paper on top of each other, elements
         *   can also overlap.
         * 
         * - By default, the element that comes later in the HTML code appears on
         *   top.
         * 
         * - If you want to control which element appears on top, use z-index.
         * - Z-index value is a number:
         *   a. Higher number = element appears more on top
         *   b. Example: An element with z-index: 10 will appear above an 
         *              element with z-index: 5
         * 
         * Example:
         *   .blue-box {
         *       background-color: blue;
         *       position: relative;
         *       z-index: 1;
         *   }
         * 
         *   .green-box {
         *       background-color: green;
         *       position: relative;
         *       top: -170px;
         *       left: 170px;
         *   }
         * 
         * - In this example:
         *   a. Blue box has relative position and z-index: 1
         *   b. Green box has default z-index: 0
         *   c. So blue box will appear above green box
         * 
         * Important Note:
         * - Z-index only works when element's position is relative, absolute
         *   or fixed
         * - It doesn't work with static position
        */

        /**

         *   d. auto

        */

        /**
         * Summary:
         * - After understanding float layouts, we now need more control.
         *   That's where position comes in.
         * - With float, things 'fight' for space and layout happens as a
         *   side-effect whereas 'position' gives us absolute control over
         *   element placement.
         * - But even position has its limit - it's great for 1-2 elements
         *   but not for responsive layouts. And this is why Flexbox and
         *   Grid were created.
         *   a. Float and Position: Old School layout tools (Manual)
         *   b. Flexbox           : layout 1D stuff easily (row or column)
