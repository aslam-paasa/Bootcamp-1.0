		/**
		 * Flexbox: (1-dimensional layout - either row or column)
         * 1. div is a block element, which takes full width of the parent element,
         *    and so new elements will be placed in a new line.
		 * 2. Whenever I want something to sit next to each other, I just
		 *    have to use "display: flex" on the parent element. Then the
		 *    children elements will sit next to each other (row-wise).
		 * 3. Using "justify-content", I can put space around those children elements.
		 * 4. The ul element doesn't have enough room, because of that the ul elements
		 *    are squished together. Using flex-basis, we can set the width of the 
		 *    ul element.
		 * 5. align-items is used to position the child items in the center of the 
		 *    parent element. It is used to vertically center the items, means we
		 *    can position them anywhere at the center of the parent element from
		 *    top to bottom.
         * 6. flex-wrap means that the child elements will place in the next line,
         *    if they don't fit in the parent element.
         * 7. gap is used to add space between the child elements both in row and column.
         * 8. flex: 1 means the child will get equal space in the parent element.
         *    And if we put flex:2, then the space will be double from the flex:1.
         * 9. order is used to change the order of the child elements. For example,
         *    if we put order: 1, then the child element will be placed at the end
         *    of the parent element. If we put order: -1, then the child element
         *    will be placed at the beginning of the parent element. 
         *    (Priority based ordering)

		/**
		 * How can I display row wise and column wise?
		 * 1. display: flex;
		 * 2. flex-direction: row;  (default - no need to write)
		 * 3. flex-direction: column;
		 * 
		 * Note: 
		 * 1. If we use flex-direction: column, then the aligned items
		 *    will be in the center of the parent element from 
		 *    left to right.
		 * 2. If we use flex-direction: row, then the aligned items
		 *    will be in the center of the parent element from 
		 *    top to bottom.
