			/**
			 * Responsive Websites:
			 * - Responsiveness is the idea of our layout looking great across
			 *   all different kinds of devices.
			 * - Invention of mobile phone revolutionized or changed how we
			 *   approach web development entirely. We are not longer get away
			 *   with fixed screen sizes anymore, we have to make sure that our
			 *   website look good across all different devices.
			 * 
			 * Q. What makes a site responsive?
			 * => When we are talking about responsiveness, we are talking
			 *    about three really important ideas:
			 *    a. Fluid
			 *    b. Elastic
			 *    c. Content Decisions
			 * 
			 * 1. Fluidity: 
			 *  - When everything is a percentage or can respond natively,
			 *    then we have a fluid site.
			 *  - If we look at the layouts that we did, those are really
			 *    fluid. It can go from full screen to mobile size screen.
			 *  - As it is resizing, it is working.
			 * 
			 *  - Eventually we are going to make content decisions and
			 *    those content decisions are going to be at certain sizes.
			 *    They way our sites look good in between the sizes that we
			 *    choose is the fluidity. The fluidity is what makes it so
			 *    it doesn't seem jarring when we make our content decision.
			 *  - It kind of just works all the way up to that decision point
			 *    then we make the decision, we are still good.
			 * 
			 * 2. Elastic: [EMs & REM]
			 *    a. EM: Relative to the font-size of the parent element.
			 *    b. REM: Relative to the font-size of the root element.
			 * 
			 *  - Font Size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties
			 *    like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case
			 *    of other properties like width.
			 * 
			 *  - Elasticity at its core, setting our texts and fonts to use a
			 *    responsive unit of measure, so that responsive unit of measure
			 *    that we're going to use is called an 'em' or 'rem'.
			 *  - Let's imagine we are building a website for our company and we
			 *    built out all the css. It's 5000lines of CSS, and we take the
			 *    site to our boss to show him. He said "The website looks great
			 *    but I just all the fonts to double the size". Now we need to go
			 *    line by line through our CSS and we need to not only find all the
			 *    pixel values that we have made for our font-size but also have to
			 *    do the math to double them. But if we have used 'em', we just have
			 *    to make one change on one line.
			 * 
			 *  - When we use 'em', they get their font-size from the parent element.
			 *  - <p> paragraph's parent is the <section>. So, on our section
			 *    we put a font-size of 10px, and if I made my paragraph font-size
			 *    1em, how many pixel is that paragraph now? => 10px, because the
			 *    section has the font-size of 10px on it, and 'em' is the responsive
			 *    unit of measure, and get their font-size from the parent element.
			 * 
			 * - If I want to change all of my pixels and every single bit of font
			 *   that's inside that section, I want it to be double, how could I
			 *   make every single bit of text be double the size?
			 *   => Change the font-size of section: 20px
			 *   => Now all the fonts inside section gets doubled. Now, 1em is no
			 *      longer 10px, 1em is 20px.
			 * 
			 *   Note: I have to do only 1 change and the while font-size changes.
			 *   That's the beauty of elasticity.
			 * 
			 * Issue: The problem with 'em' is, anyone can come along and put another
			 * containing element inside section, and if that containing element has
			 * a font-size, that's what our 'em' will be equal to.
			 * 
			 * The 'em' only goes with the closest parent with a font-size. So, if
			 * we are working on a big team and somebody else come along and puts
			 * a parent with a different font-size, our em's might not be the size
			 * that we are expect them to be.
			 * 
			 * Solution:
			 * So, not have to worry about other team members or maybe ourselve
			 * coming along and putting another parent element with a different
			 * font-size we have 'rem'. 'rem' stands for 'root em's' and they only
			 * get their font-size from the html element. Whatever size we put on
			 * the html element is where they get their styling from.
			 * So, if we ever want to double the size of my text, we could go and
			 * change the font-size of html.
			 * 
			 * - We are using our browser with default font-size. The default font
			 *   size for every browser is 16px. But I don't want to do the Math
			 *   everytime. So, I set my font-size to 62.5%.
			 * - Now the 62.5% of 16px gives us what? 10px.
			 * - Another benefit is, if someone else sets their default font-size
			 *   to something bigger, all of our font will respect the font-size
			 *   that they set.
			 * 
			 * 
			 *    <section>
			 *       <p>Spam dominos in chat</p>
			 *    </section>
			 * 
			 *    html {
			 *       font-size: 62.5%;
			 *    }
			 *    section {
			 *       font-size: 10px;
			 *    }
			 *    p {
			 *       font-size: 1em
			 *    }
			 *    
			 *    VS
			 * 
			 *    p {
			 *       font-size: 1 rem;
			 *    }
			 *    
			 * 
			 * 3. Content Decision:
			 *  - In a truly responsive website, we have to make some decisions 
			 *    about what content we show:
			 *    a. on mobile, do we want to show the sidbar?
			 *    b. on mobile, do we want to show the navigational content?
			 *  - On mobile, we really don't need them to see any of the stuff.
			 *  - So, at different screen sizes, we are going to make those
			 *    content decisions.
			 * 
			 * Q. How to make content decisions?
			 * Q. What do we use to get rid of the content that we don't want them
			 *    to see or to remove things that we don't care about? What do we
			 *    use?
			 * => To make the content decisions, we use: Media Queries
			 *  
			 *    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
			 *       h1 {
			 *          color: blue;
			 *       }
			 *    }
			 * 
			 * => Media Queries enables us say that at this viewport or at this
			 *    screen size, do these things in terms of CSS Rules.
			 * => In media queries, there are two school of thoughts:
			 *    a. Take your design, shrink it until it doesn't look good, shrink
			 *       it again until it doesn't look good, that's our media query.
			 *    b. Mobile First: The idea started with the mobile layout first
			 *       and then adding stuffs as you have more screen state.[Popular]
			 * 
			 * Ex: Whenever we see "screen", that really means '0'. And between 0px
			 *     and 600px, I want to make our section's background color: green.
			 * 
			 *     @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
			 *        section {
			 *           background-color: green;
			 *        }
			 *     }
			 * 
			 * Ex: 601px to 900px, I want section's background-color: blue
			 *     @media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 900px) {
			 *        section {
			 *           background-color: blue;
			 *        }
			 *     }
			 * 
			 * Ex: 601px to 900px, I want section's background-color: blue
			 *     @media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 900px) {
			 *        section {
			 *           background-color: blue;
			 *        }
			 *     }
			 * 
			 * Ex: Between 601px to 900px, .thiccOne is going to disappear and
			 *     fix the blank space created by .thiccOne (33.33%).
			 * 
			 *     @media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 900px) {
			 *        section {
			 *           background-color: blue;
			 *           width: 33.33%
			 *        }
			 * 
			 *        .thiccOne {
			 *            display: none;
			 *        }
			 *     }
			 * 
			 * => We have the ability to have tight control over all of
			 *    the content-decisions that we make just using media
			 *    queries.
			 * => And the way we stack them, and the decisions we make,
			 *    we will get better our time.
			 * 
			 * Note: vw & vh are responsive units of measure.
			 *       a. viewport width : 1vw = 1% of viewport width
			 *       b. viewport height: 1vh = 1% of viewport height
			 *       Agar hum screensize ko chota bada kare to uske according
			 *       vw & vh change hoga.
			 *       
			 *       Ex: If viewport width is 1000px, then 1vw = 10px
			 *           If viewport width is 500px, then 1vw  = 5px
			*/

			/**
			 * Important Additional to the template:
			 * - To all of the above thing to work, we need to add something to our
			 *   template:
			 *    
			 * - Above media queries actually don't work on mobile like it work on 
			 *   browsers. But we need to tell the browser to figure out the width
			 *   on this screen no matter what device we are on, and by having this
			 *   "width=device-width", our media queries will work not only on desktop,
			 *   laptops, but it will also work on tablet, mobiles.
			 * - So, if we ever making our media queries and if it's not working
			 *   then we should make sure whether these viewport is added or not.
			 * 
			 * - "initial-scale=1" is the zoom level that we start off with.
			 * 
			 * - There is one more property called "user-scalable=no". This will
			 *   stop user from pinching and zooming and making our site bigger.
