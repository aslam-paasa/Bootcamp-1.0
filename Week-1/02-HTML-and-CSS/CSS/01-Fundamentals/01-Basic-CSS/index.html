		  * => But there are some cases like email. In email, we can't link
		  *    external style sheet, so we have to do inline styling.
		  * => There is a chance we could use some css in the head at the
		  *    beginning of the document. 
		  * => Amazon has publicly stated that for every 1sec their page load
		  *    speed decreases they lose a million dollars a day. So, amazon
		  *    used something called 'critical path css'. It's the css that we
		  *    absolutely need above the fold means before we starts scrolling
		  *    everything that we see when the page renders that's above the 
		  *    fold, and we have to scroll that's below the fold. So, amazon
		  *    put a little bit of css in the head of their document that just
		  *    loads the css above the fold, and remaining everything goes on
		  *    a separate css file. And this gives them slight increase in
		  *    performance that can actually save the money.

		 /**
		  * CSS Syntax: [Spelling and Grammar Rules]
		  * - CSS is a markup language so it has a special way to write it.
		  * - Whenever we write css, we are writing rules. So, this whole
		  *   below thing are rules.
		  * - Rules are then broken down into 'selectors' & 'declaration blocks'.
		  * - Declaration Blocks are then broken down into declarations. And
		  *   declarations are then broken down into 'properties & values'.
		  * 
		  * - p {
		  *       color    : red;
		  *       property : propertyValue
		  *      < ---------------------- >
		  *            Declaration
		  *   }
		  * 
		  * - When we are writing css, we are trying to tell the browser:
		  *   "Hey! I want some content to look a particular way". So, in this
		  *   rule, we have a selector(p), which tells the browser "I want every
		  *   paragraph to look this way". So, inside of our "declaration block"
		  *   goes all the declarations i.e. the things we are telling the browser
		  *   that what we want to have happen to that kind of content. So, we 
		  *   have said "I want all my paragraphs to have this particular style".
		  *   Then we have on each line declarations that are going to how I want
		  *   that content to be styled.
		  * - We have 2 declarations, and those declarations are broken down
		  *   into properties & values:
		  *   a. color: red;
		  *   b. font-weight: bold;  
		  * 
		  * Summary:
		  * 1. Selector, p in this case, specifies which part of the HTML
		  *    document should be styled by the declaration. This selector
		  *    will style all p elements on the page. 
		  * 2. Declaration block is curly braces, and inside those declaration
		  *    blocks, the css code is called declarations. Then those
		  *    declarations are broken down into property & value.
		  * 3. This example has 2 declarations.
		  * 
		  *       p {
		  *          color: red;
		  *          font-weight: bold;
		  *       }
		 */
		
		 /**
		  * Meaning of Cascade:
		  * 1. CSS is read top-to-bottom.
		  * 2. What comes below, can override what came above. This is
		  *    called the "Cascade".
		  * 
		  *    p {
		  *       color: red;
		  *       font-weight: bold;
		  *    }
		  *    p {
		  *       color: blue;
		  *    }
		  * 
		  *    The paragraph is going to be blue but it also be bold, because
		  *    we didn't override any font-weight.

		  * 
		  * Q. Why we have three different fonts above?
		  * => They are the fallbacks. If for some reason we are not able to get
		  *    'Source Sans Pro' from google, then its going to try using 
		  *    'Helvetica', and if for some reason we are not able to get
		  *    'Helvetica' then it just the default 'sans-serif' font.
		  * 
		  * Q. Why are we importing only font-weight: 400 & 700?
