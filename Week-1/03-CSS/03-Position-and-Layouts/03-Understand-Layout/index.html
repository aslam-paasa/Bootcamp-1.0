         * Till now as we have learned about the box model in CSS, now let's
         * start learning about the layouts, positioning and flow of elements.
        */

        /**
         * Display and Positioning in CSS:
         * - A browser will render the element of an HTML document that has no
         *   CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they
         *   exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in
         *   HTML.
         * - In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML
         *   element, CSS includes properties that change how a browser
         *   positions elements. These properties specify where an element
         *   is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other
         *   element, and other related attributes.
         * - In this section, we will learn five properties for adjusting the
         *   position of the HTML in the browser:
         *   2. float
         *   3. clear
         *   4. visibility
         *   5. display
         *   6. position
         *   7. z-index
         * 
         * Note: Each of these properties will allow us to position and view
         *       elements on a web page. 
        */

        /**
         * Layout: (Float & Clear float Concept)
         * - To start off with our layouts, we are going to use floats.
         * - Flexbox and grid are far superior and easy, but floats are
         *   way harder.
         * - Floats really don't need any special vocabulary. It's just
         *   percentages. And if we can do percentages, we will know how
         *   to layout stuffs with floats.
         * - Whenever we float an element, it's gonna fight as hard as it
         *   can to get into a corner. So, if I want to float this aside
         *   to the left, it can go as much top as it can and it can go
         *   as left as it can. Basically, trying to fight to get into
         *   the corner.
         * 
         * - The idea of float is to fight for its life to get into the
         *   corner.
         * - And when we try to layout a page using floats, we are using a
         *   side-effect. If everything is trying to get into the corner
         *   well then stuffs will sit next to each other.
         * - For example, I want to float both of these elements(side bar
         *   and main content) to the left. So, both of these element will
         *   go up and left as much as they can, and the side effect would
         *   be that they will be sitting next to each other. And this is
         *   the core of how layouts could be achieved with floats.
         *   [They will not overlap].

         *   This layout contains three sections:
         *   a. Header
         *   b. Footer
         *   c. Two sections
         * 
         * Q. How can I get three sections sitting next to each other?
         * => Float them all to the left, but I will also need to give
         *    them a percentage, because they didn't have a width on them
         *    i.e. 33.3333%.
         * 
         * Q. How can we sit these 3 elements next to each other?
         *  section {
         *      height: 300px;
         *      width: 33.3333%;
         *      border: 3px solid black; 
         *      float: left;
         *  }
         * => float them => float: left; 
         * => It break the layout.
         * 
         * Q. How to fix footer?
         * => We will use 'clear: both':
         *      header, footer {
         *          height: 100px;
         *          border: 3px solid black;
         *          clear: both;
         *      }
         * => "clear: both" kind of like telling both the header and the
         *    footer at the moment, look to the left and right. If there
         *    is anything floating come after it.
         * => It's basically telling you to look before crossing the street.
         *    It looks to the left, it sees those floating sections then it
         *    will stay come after the float.
         * => This solves the footer problem, but we still have one last
         *    problem that is to fix the section.
         * 
         * Q. We have 3 sections but only two of them sitting next to
         *    each other?
         * => We are running out of room because of the border. So, its
         *    33.33% + 33.33%  + 33.33% + (3+3+3+3+3+3px borders) break
         *    the section and the last will move to the next line.
         * => To solve this, we could tell the browser ignore the border
         *    when you are calculating the width.
         *    
         *    * {
         *       box-sizing: border-box;
         *    }
