         * Why learn position after float?
         * - When using float, you're kind of hacking layout by making things
         *   "fight for corners". But floats weren't meant for full page
         *   layouts- they were originally for wrapping text around images!
         *   So, after floats became messy for layout, developers turned to
         *   'position', which gave more direct and powerful control over
         *   where elements sits on the page.
        */

        /**
         * Understanding Position:
         * CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
         * This box will either be a block-level box or an inline-level box.
         * 
         * 1. Block-level elements:
         *    - Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main
         *      building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow 
         *      between surrounding text.
         *    - You can control how much space each box takes up by setting
         *      the width of the boxes(and sometimes the height, too).
         *    - To separate boxes, we can use borders, margins, padding,
         *      and background colors. 
         *    - Ex: Block-Level Element: <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>
         *          (Start on a new line)
         * 
         *    - The block-level elements in the above take up their own line
         *      of space and therefore don't overlap each other.
         *    - Block-level elements also consistently appear on the left
         *      side of the browser. 
         *    - This is the default position for block-level elements.
         * 
         * Note: 
         * > The position property in CSS determines how an element is
         *   positioned in the document.
         * > There are five main positioning values:
         *   1. Static (default)
         *   2. Relative
         *   3. Absolute
         *   4. Fixed
         *   5. Sticky
         * 
         * > Each of these values affects how an element is placed in
         *   relation to its: 
         *   - normal position, 
         *   - parent elements, or 
         *   - the viewport.

         *    - 'top', 'right', 'right' and 'left' properties do not work with static.
         *    - The element does not respond to z-index.
         *    - Example:

         *         position: static;   (Default Behavior)
         *         top: 50px;          (Will NOT work)

         *    - The element remains in the normal document flow.

         *      element relative to its original positon.
         *    - Other elements do not occupy the moved space.
         *    - Can act as a reference for absolutely positioned child elements.

         *      .box {
         *         position: relative;
         *         top: 20px    (Moves 20px down from its original position)
         *         left: 30px;  (Moves 30px to the right)
         *      }
         *

         *      Useful when you want to move an element without affecting 
         *      surrounding elements.

        /**
         * 3. Position: Absolute
         *    - When an element's position is set to 'absolute', all other
         *      elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it
         *      is not present on the page. 
         *    - It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned 
         *      (non-static) ancestor.
         *    - If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to
         *      the <html> document.
         *    - Other elements collapse into its space.
         *    - The 'top', 'left', 'right', and 'bottom' properties work
         *      as expected.
         * 
         *    - Consider the example below:
         * 
         *      <div class="parent">
         *          <div class="child">I'm absolute!</div>

         *          background: #eee;
         *      }
         * 
         *      .child {
         *          position: absolute;
         *          top: 20px;
         *          right: 30px;
         *          background: #ff0000;
         *      }
         * 
         *    - In the above example, we have a parent div with position: relative
         *      and a child div with position: absolute.
         *    - The child div is positioned 20px from the top and 30px from the right
         *      of its parent container, not the page.
         *    - This happens because the parent has position: relative, making it the
         *      positioning context for the absolutely positioned child.
         *    - Without position: relative on the parent, the child would position
         *      itself relative to the document body.
         * 
         *    - Use Case:
         *      Used in modal popups, tooltips, dropdowns, and elements 
         *      that should be positioned independently of the normal flow.

         *    - The element remains in view while scrolling but is
         *      constrained within its parent container.
         *    - Requires at least one of 'top', 'left', 'right', or
         *      'bottom' properties.
         * 
         *    - Example:
         *      .box-bottom {
         *          position: sticky;
         *          top: 240px;

         *      }
         * 
         *    - In the above example:
         *      1. The box will scroll normally
         *      2. When the box reaches 240px from the top, it will stick there
         *      3. The box will stay stuck until the parent container ends
         *      4. After the parent container ends, the box will scroll normally

         *    - Use Cases:
         *      Sticky Navigation bars, table headers, and important UI
         *      elements that should remain visible while scrolling.

        /**
         * Z-Index & Stacking Context:
         * 
         * 1. What is z-index?
         *    - The z-index property controls which element appears on top
         *      when they overlay.
         *    - Works only on elements with 'relative', 'absolute', 'fixed'
         *      or 'sticky' positioning.
         *    - Higher 'z-index' values bring elements forward, while lower
         *      values push them behind.
         *    - Example:
         *      .box1 {
         *         position: absolute:
         *         z-index: 1;  (Behind)
         *         background: blue;
         *      }
         *    
         *      .box-2 {
         *         position: absolute;
         *         z-index;     (In front)
         *         background: red;
         *      }
         * 
         * 
         * 2. What is Stacking Context?
         *    - A new stacking context is created when:
         *      a. An element has a z-index value other than 'auto' and
         *         a 'position' other than 'static'.
         *      b. Certain CSS properties (like opacity: <1) create a new
         *         stacking context.
         *    - Example:
         *      .container {
         *         positon: relative;
         *         z-index: 10;
         *      }
         *    
         *      .child {
         *         position: absolute;
         *         z-index: 5;  (This is relative to .container, not the document)
         *      }
         *    
         *    - Key Takeaway:
         *      Elements inside a stacking context cannot exceed their
         *      parent's z-index limit.
         * 
         * 3. Example:
         *    - If you want to control which element appears on top, use z-index.
         *    - Z-index value is a number:
         *      a. Higher number = element appears more on top
         *      b. Example: An element with z-index: 10 will appear above an 
         *                 element with z-index: 5
         *    
         *      .blue-box {
         *          background-color: blue;
         *          position: relative;
         *          z-index: 1;
         *      }
         *    
         *      .green-box {
         *          background-color: green;
         *          position: relative;
         *          top: -170px;
         *          left: 170px;
         *      }
         *    
         *    - In this example:
         *      a. Blue box has relative position and z-index: 1
         *      b. Green box has default z-index: 0
         *      c. So blue box will appear above green box
         * 
         * Important Note:
         * - Z-index only works when element's position is relative, absolute
         *   or fixed
         * - It doesn't work with static position
        */

        /**
         * Concept of handling overflowing content:
         * - When content exceeds the element's boundaries, it overflows.
         * - To handle this, we use overflow property.

        /**
         * Summary:
         * - After understanding float layouts, we now need more control.
         *   That's where position comes in.
         * - With float, things 'fight' for space and layout happens as a
         *   side-effect whereas 'position' gives us absolute control over
         *   element placement.
         * - But even position has its limit - it's great for 1-2 elements
         *   but not for responsive layouts. And this is why Flexbox and
         *   Grid were created.
         *   a. Float and Position: Old School layout tools (Manual)
         *   b. Flexbox           : layout 1D stuff easily (row or column)
